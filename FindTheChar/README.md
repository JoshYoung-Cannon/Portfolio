# Find The Char

Task: Create a method that is given a String, int and a char. 
The method will return true if the input char is in the String at the location of the index.

e.g. (String "Hello", int 2, char 'e') -> returns true
     (String "Apple", int 4, char 'a') -> returns false 

note: the case of the char should not matter
